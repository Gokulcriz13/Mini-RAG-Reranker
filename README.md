# Mini RAG + Reranker Sprint

## Overview
This project implements a small Question Answering (QA) service over a set of **20 public PDFs on industrial & machine safety**.  
It uses embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) + FAISS for baseline similarity search, then improves ranking with a **hybrid reranker** (vector + BM25 keyword).

## Features
- PDF ingestion + chunking â†’ stored in SQLite
- Embeddings with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Baseline FAISS search (cosine similarity)
- Hybrid reranker (FAISS + SQLite FTS5 BM25)
- Flask API `/ask` for answering questions
- Abstain mechanism when results are too weak
- Answers are short, extractive, and cite their source

## Learned in it

In this assessment i gained a quick learning on how a RAG model supports the Q/A model by refinig and
finetuning the text extracted from itself, I made it as a two division one covers the Handling of Data Starts
with storing PDF, Making it into chunks that can be easily stored in the SQLite chunk.db and splitting the
chunks into paragraphs of upto 300 words, then created the embeddings with the recommended model
(all-MiniLM-L6-V2) used sentence-transformers and also generated FAISS indexing helps to retrive the data
 be making it vector similiarity search within the chuncksand i also saved the DB row IDs for better
tracability makes the storing of chuncks and baseline search made the completion of the phase 1

After completing around 60% of the assessment pipeline, the balance leftovers were hybrid comparison
using BM25 made a new knowledge on RAG model that actually works well like the sentence-tarnsformer
and made it good and i created the API using flask to make it accessible for the frontend applications
 to check the api i also created the benchmarking using benchmarking.py on the two different methods
to check the API working and comparison between baseline and reranker hybrid working well.

This completes the pipeline of the Mini-RAG + Reranker Sprint.

It is a best oppurtunity to work in RAG models!!
